## 💡 About The Project
**SWaRMS** is a Full Stack solution designed to modernize municipal waste management. It bridges the gap between citizens and authorities by providing a real-time, geo-tagged reporting platform.

I built this project to solve the issue of delayed waste collection. Unlike simple forms, this is a complete ecosystem that tracks a report from "Uploaded" to "Resolved," with a secure admin dashboard for management.
